👋 Hi, this is Tamás Jákob's account for data science projects!

I'm passionate about data science and love to build data-driven solutions. Here’s what I do:

💻 I build data-based products that solve real-world problems.  
🔧 I mostly work with Python.  
🌱 I enjoy learning and experimenting with new tools and techniques to stay on the cutting edge.  
📚 Please check the following projects:
- YOLO object detection for robots to reduce the error rate (python|YOLO|object detection ): where I developed a machine learning-based algorithm that provides much better performance in changing physical environments and lighting conditions 
- IOS app analysis (python|polars|pandas): iOS app analysis, where business value needs to be generated based on user behavior. The main goal is to understand the reasons for conversion propensity in order to achieve higher revenue.
